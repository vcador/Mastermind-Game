# Mastermind-Game
Create a C# console application that is a simple version of Mastermind. The randomly generated answer should be four(4) digits in length, with each digit between the numbers 1 and 6. After the player enters a combination, a minus(-) sign should be printed for every digit that is correct position. Nothing should be printed for incorrect digits. The player has ten(10) attempts to guess the number correctly before receiving a message that they have lost.
